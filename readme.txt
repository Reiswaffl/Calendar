Hello, i'm a read me file. 
This my project. 
The files on the first page you can ignore, it just was the first construct. 
For each prototype there will be a folder; propably even more if a prototype is quiet big and take a little more time than others.
I think it shouldn't be that difficult to navigate.

Have a nice day, your readme-file :)
