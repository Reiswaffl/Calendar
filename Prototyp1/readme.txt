Hello I'm the Prototype 1.0. I can read information from a xml- File and write it trough the console. 
The classes that are really used for something are "Interface", "DayObject", "PeriodObject" and "ONode", 
even if the last three of them aren't used yet. 
The calendar.xml-File got a DTD and could be used if the Programm could write Information to file.
Because this isn't possible yet, there are some example-elements.

Have a nice day:)
